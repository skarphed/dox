                <p>
                    As mentioned earlier, the core-object represents a website that you create with skarphed. The core object bears the logo of skarphed and has the name you gave it while creating it. You can open it's objectpage by doubleclicking on it in the object-tree.
                </p>
                <h3>The Settings</h3>
                <p>
                    In the core's object-page, you can edit a bunch of settings, that are the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Repository:
                        <p>As of now you can use only one <em>skarphed-repo</em> as a source for repositories and templates. You were forced to enter a repository to use with this <em>skarphed-core</em> at the time of creation, so a repo was already set here. You can enter another repo here, for example when a repository is being moved from one URL to another. It is an upcoming feature that you can use multiple repositories and this setting can be thought of as deprecated by now.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Maintenance Mode:
                        <p>If you do not want to be the website shown to the public, you can activate the <em>Maintenance Mode</em>. If it is activated, any call to the website will result in a message, that it is currently undergoing maintenance and is not reachable. The <em>Maintenance-Mode</em> is activated by default in newly installed websites that have no template installed. It will be deactivated automatically when you install a template.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Rendermode:
                        <p>Pages that are being rendered by <em>skarphed-core</em> can be rendered in two different modes. The <em>Pure</em>-mode which will only deliver pure HTML to your audience and the <em>AJAX</em>-mode which will execute actions instant whithout reloading the whole page.</p>
                        <h4>Pure rendermode</h4>
                        <p>this rendermode will render every view on the page and deliver it to your audience. It will not deliver any code that has to be executed on the clientside (except if a template tells <em>skarphed-core</em> to do so). This has the advantage that your audience does not necessarily need a browser that supports JavaScript or, that they are forced to use JavaScript if they do not want to. Purely rendered websites are straightforward HTML over HTTP.</p>
                        <h4>AJAX rendermode</h4>
                        <p>The AJAX rendermode does the following: If a view is called, that does not refer to another website or another view, it will do an AJAX-call that loads only the changing widgets from the server and integrate the result into the page the browser already loaded. This results in lesser loading time when page is already loaded, but potentially more loading time when the page is loaded the first time. <b> AJAX mode is not implemented yet </b></p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>The Operation Daemon</h3>
                <p>
                    There are a few processes that potentially take a longer time than the average HTTP-Call, for example installing or updating modules. We call these processes <em>operations</em>. There is one Worker that runs in the background of every <em>skarphed-core</em> that runs these operations, which is called the <em>Operation Daemon</em>. In this fied of the <em>skarphed-core</em>s adminpage you can control the <em>Operation Daemon</em>, for example when you want to delay operations for some reason by pausing it. Or for example there is a server restart and the daemon does not start by default.
                </p>
                <h3>The Public Key</h3>
                <p>
                    As every component in the skarphed-system does, every <em>skarphed-core</em> has its own public key. This key is used to sign critical data, that is being transmitted to your <em>skarphed-admin</em>. The <em>Public Key</em>-field displays this <em>skarphed-core</em>'s public key, so you can verify it if you have to.
