                    In a <em>skarphed-core</em> there can be several users that are allowed to edit the contents and setup. How to manage them is being explained here.<br>
                    One of the sub-objects of the <em>skarphed-core</em> in the object tree is a object called <em>Users</em>. If you expand it, you will see the users that are registered to that <em>skarphed-core</em>
                </p>
                <h3>The root User</h3>
                <p>
                    On creation of a <em>skarphed-core</em> there is one special user. The so called <em>root</em>-user. The rootuser is the mightiest user on a <em>skarphed-core</em> due to the fact that no permission-checks apply to him. He is not meant for regular use like editing content. His purpose is to do administrative tasks and provide other users with permissions. The root-user is not deletable.
                </p>
                <h3>Creating a User</h3>
                <p>
                    Right mouseclick on the <em>Users</em>-object in the object tree → Click on <em>Create User...</em>. Now a dialog should pop up that asks you for the name of the new user. Enter the name and press <em>OK</em>. You should now have a new user.
                </p>
                <h3>The User-objectpage</h3>
                <h4> Permissions </h4>
                <p>
                    Permissions allow users to do certain things, for example add a new role or install a module. In the <em>Permissions</em>-section you can adjust the permissions of a user. On the left side you can assign or revoke granular permissions from und to the user. Please note that you can only assign a permission to another user if you possess that permission yourself (the user you are logged in as) or if you are root. Be careful: you can revoke permissions from yourself and normally you won't want that.<br>
                </p>
                <h4> Roles </h4>
                <p>
                    On the right side you can assign or revoke roles from or to a user. Roles are basically accumulations of permissions and are being described more detailed in the section <em>Roles</em>. Assigning and revoking roles works similar to assigning permissions. Please note that, if you assigned a role to a user, the permissions that are included in this role, will not be displayed in the permissions-list on the right side anymore to keep the list simpler.
                </p>
                <h4> Password editing </h4>
                <p>
                    If you have the permission to edit user's passwords or you look at your own user, you will see a <em>Password</em>-section. You can edit the users password here.
                </p>
                <h3> Deleting Users </h3>
                <p>
                    You can delete a user by right mouseclicking on them in the object-tree and selecting <em>Delete...</em> in the context-menu. You will be asked to confirm the deletion. Confirm and your user will be deleted.
                </p>
                <h3> Roles </h3>
                <p>
                    Another sub-object of <em>skarphed-core</em> in the object tree is the <em>Roles</em>-object. It enables you to create, edit and delete roles. Roles are basically lists of permissions that are thematically grouped together. So you can realize access-levels of persons more conveniently. Roles can be assinged to users exactly as permissions can be. When you expand the roles-object, you will see all roles that are currently known to the <em>skarphed-core</em>
                </p>
                <h3> Creating and editing a role </h3>
                <p>
                    A role is created by right mouseclicking on the <em>Roles</em>-object in the object tree and selecting <em>Create Role...</em> in the context-menu. You will be asked for a name. Afterwards you will see your new <em>Role</em> in the object tree. Please double click on that role in the object tree to edit it. It's object page looks kind of similar to the one of ther <em>User</em>. You can simply add and revoke permissons from or to the role by clicking the checkboxes left to the corresponding permission in the list.
                </p>
                <h3> Deleting a role</h3>
                <p>
                    Right mouseclick on the role in the object tree and select <em>Delete...</em> in the context-menu. You will be asked to confirm to decision. After you confirmed, the concerned role will be deleted.
                </p>
