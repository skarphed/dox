                <p>
                    Templates are somewhat like a theme for <em>skarphed-core</em>. They determine the visual style of the website.
                    If you want to create templates, please refer to the corresponding section in the developers manual.
                    <em>Templates</em> is a sub-object of a <em>skarphed-core</em> in the object-tree. You can doubleclick on it to open the <em>Template</em>-objectpage to configure the template. 
                </p>
                <h3> Installing a template </h3>
                <p>
                    You have two options to install a template:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Upload a template:
                        <p>You can upload a template that you have packaged yourself or downloaded from some other source as a .tar.gz-file. Please choose the file you want to upload via the file chooser dialog and then press <em>OK</em>. The template should now be uploaded to the server. If everything went as planned, the template name will change and your new template is installed. The template will not be installed if there are errors in the template files. These errors are currently <b>not</b> being shown to the user. There will be a error report in the future. This will be handy if you are developing templates.<br>
                        You will use manual template upload a lot if you are designing websites for people that have special wishes, or you just want to design templates for other people.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Install a template from a Repository:
                        <p>If your <em>skarphed-core</em>'s repository has stored any templates, you will see them in the <em>Install from Repository</em>-list. Just double-click on one to install it.<br>
                        You will use these features a lot if you just want to share information on the internet and do not need a custom design on your website or if you build your own repository.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3> Understanding Templates </h3>
                <p>
                    Templates are basically a bunch of html files, css directives and pictures that are needed to display the page.
                    They define <em>Site</em>s. Sites are HTML-Frames that you can place widgets in (you will read about modules and widgets soon). 
                </p>
                <h3> Caution when overinstalling Templates </h3>
                <p>
                    Please be aware, that installing a template over an existing setup, you are likely to break the display of your page, especially when your new template offers other pages and spaces than your current template does. You will have to rearrange your menus and views.
