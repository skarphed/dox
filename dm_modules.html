                <p>A module is a set of files that provide skarphed with additional functionality
                do display different kinds of content. For example an image galery, a blog or a
                simple HTML page. There may come a time when you need such content for your special
                needs that does not exist by now. The solution is to write your own. In this section,
                i will explain of which parts a module is made up, which requirements it must fulfill
                and how to get your very own module into your skarphed installation.
                </p>
                <h3> Structure of a module </h3>
                <p>
                We are going to create a folder for the development of a module.
                </p>
                <p>A module consists of two parts: One part to describe the logic that applies for
                the <i>skarphed-core</i> and one part that describes how the module is represented
                in <i>skarphed-admin</i>.
                The part relevant for <i>skarphed-admin</i> consists of at least two files. One is
                called <em>module.py</em>. Skarphed expects to find a class called <em>ModulePage</em>
                in it. It contains all controls necessary to apply configuration options that affect
                the scope of the whole module. The second, and the probably more important part is a
                file called <em>widget.py</em>. This file must contain a class called <em>WidgetPage
                </em> which defines a GUI that is used to control each widget that is being created
                of this module. Place these files in a subfolder called <em>gui</em> in the dev-folder                of your module.
                </p><p>
                Then you must place a file called <em>__init__.py</em> in the dev-folder. This file
                will contain the logic that is being used in the <i>skarphed-core</i>. Further add
                a file that is called <em>manifest.json</em>. The manifest-file contains metadata
                about your module and defines which database-tables are necessary to represent the
                data of your module in the database.<br>
                A minimal filetree should finally look like this:
                <pre>
                + myname_mymodule
                +- __init__.py
                +- manifest.json 
                +-+ gui
                  +- widget.py
                  +- module.py
                </pre>
                Typically the dev-folder will contain more files, for example you probably want
                to design the GUI for your module with glade, so you need to contain the glade-files
                </p>
